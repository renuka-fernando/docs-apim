# Quick Start Guide - Kubernetes

Let's host your first API on Choreo Connect using Kubernetes.

### Before you begin...

1.  Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
2.  Setup a [Kubernetes](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) cluster v1.14 or above.
      - Minimum CPU : 2vCPU
      - Minimum Memory : 2GB
3.  Deploy an ingress controller - [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) for this sample.

### Objectives

1.  Setup K8s API Operator in Kubernetes.
2.  Create and deploy an API project.
3.  Invoke the API using a generated key.

Let's get started...

### Step 1 - Setup Choreo Connect and K8s API Operator in Kubernetes

1.  Download the Choreo Connect v0.9.0 from
    [github release page's](https://github.com/wso2/product-microgateway/releases/tag/v0.9.0) assets and extract them
    to a folder of your choice. We will refer to this folder as the `CHOREO-CONNECT_HOME`.

2.  Using the kubectl tool, apply Kubernetes configurations for Choreo Connect.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <CHOREO-CONNECT_HOME>/k8s-artifacts/choreo-connect
    ```

3.  Let's install K8s API Operator by executing the following command.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/wso2/k8s-api-operator/releases/download/v2.0.0/api-operator-configs.yaml
    ```
    !!!info
        For more information, see [Installing the API K8s Operator]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/kubernetes-operators/k8s-api-operator/install/)

4.  Let's add the host entry to `/etc/hosts` file in order to access the Choreo Connect Router and Adapter.
    Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts` file.
    ```sh
    <INGRESS_ADDRESS>    gw.wso2.com    adapter.wso2.com
    ```

### Step 2 - Create and deploy an API project

Let's create our first project with the name "petstore" by adding the
[open API definition](https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json) of the petstore.

1.  First we need to create a Kubernetes ConfigMap with the swagger definition.

    ```bash
    kubectl create cm petstore-cm --from-literal=swagger="$(curl -k https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json)"
    ```

    !!! note
        You can also create a Kubernetes configmap with a zipped apictl project to deploy an API.

        Download the api controller (apictl) from the 
            [github release page's](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim-tooling/releases/tag/v4.0.0) assets and 
            extract them to a folder of your choice.
    
        ```bash
        export PATH=$PATH:<CLI_TOOL_EXTRACTED_LOCATION>
        ```
    
        ```bash
        apictl init petstore --oas https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
        ```
    
        The project is now initialized. You should notice a directory with the name "petstore" being created in the location where you executed the command. Let's zip the created "petstore"` directory and create a Kubernetes condfigmap.
    
        You can also use this Kubernetes configmap to deploy APIs.
    
        ```bash
        zip -r petstore.zip petstore/
        kubectl create cm petstore-cm --from-file petstore.zip
        ```

2.  Now let's deploy our first API by creating an API resource in Kubernetes.

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: wso2.com/v1alpha2
    kind: API
    metadata:
        name: petstore-api
    spec:
        swaggerConfigMapName: petstore-cm
    EOF
    ```

### Step 3 - Invoke the API

1.  The next step would be to invoke the API using a REST tool. Since APIs on the Choreo Connect are by default secured, 
    we need a valid token in order to invoke the API.
    Use the following sample token accepted by the Choreo Connect to access the API. 
    Let's set the token to the command line as a variable.

    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "https://gw.wso2.com/testkey" -d "scope=read:pets" -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -k -v)
    ```

2.  We can now invoke the API running on the Choreo Connect using cURL as below.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://gw.wso2.com/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
    ```

You have successfully created your first API on the Choreo Connect and invoked it.
