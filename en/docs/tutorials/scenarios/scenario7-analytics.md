# Scenario 7 - Analytics

GOGO Transit has identified a new business opportunity; since the train arrival data contains the number of passengers in each arrival, it could be used to predict the crowd in the station for a certain time period. Therefore, the services built around the station such as stores in the mall and cab services could use this data to optimize the number of employees they require for the services for each day. Thus, GOGO Transit decides to provide the passenger details API to the public with the subscription capability that generates revenue based on the number of successful requests completed within a time period.

Letâ€™s generate some traffic. We have deployed an API (**PassengerInfoAPI**) in super tenant domain. 

1. Go to the [https://localhost:9443/devportal/](https://localhost:9443/devportal/) and select carbon.super tenant domain.
2. Log on using `peter` with password `user123` and subscribe to **PassengerInfoAPI** API and generate an access token.
3. Invoke the API using the token.

```
curl -X GET "https://localhost:8243/info/1.0.0/passenger-count" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -k

```
