# Scenario 2 - Engage Access Control to the API

ColTrain has a separate API to manage schedules for their internal staff. This API needs to have more elevated permission levels to access than their public API. All the employees in the ColTrain company have access to the end-user application where they can view the train schedule details using this API.  All the staff in the ColTrain should be able to check the available schedules whereas only the staff with admin privileges can add, edit or remove the existing schedule. Any other registered or public user should not be able to view this API since it is there for internal tasks. Coltrain wants to have a clear separation on who can view and access their APIs. They have identified that it would be a cumbersome task If they are to implement this from scratch to their backend APIs directly. Since now they are using an API Management platform, they wanted to move all these authentication and authorization tasks out of their internal APIs. This would be beneficial for their internal teams because they only have to pay attention to their APIs business logic only.

**_Time to Complete : 7 mins_**

We could configure the API to be visible for a set of users. For example, this API should be visible for only Developer Portal users with **coltrain_employee** role only.

Also WSO2 API Manager provides capability to provide access control to the resources of the API by using OAuth2 scopes. Requests containing access tokens with the correct scope will be able to access these resources. 

![Access control description]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/acl-description.png)

!!! Note 
    This setup contains roles **schedule_admin**  and **coltrain_employee** already created in the ColTrain tenant domain. **schedule_admin** and **coltrain_employee** roles are assigned to the user **jenny@coltrain.com** and only **coltrain_employee** role is assigned to **george@coltrain.com** . 


Lets create a separate API named **ColTrainInternalTimeTableAPI** for this and set the visibility of that API based on roles. 

1. Log on to the Publisher Portal again `https://localhost:9443/publisher/` . Use user credentials as `apiprovider@coltrain.com` and password as `user123`.
2. Create a new API using the OpenAPI definition **coltrain-openapi.yaml** provided in the `/resources` location. Lets use _/coltrain-schedule_ as the context. Use the endpoint provided in the file as it is.

    ![Create API]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/coltrain-internal-api-create.png)

3. Go to **Develop → Portal Configurations → Basic Info** and under the **Developer portal visibility**, select **Restrict by role(s)** . This would enable another field to set the role. Use **coltrain_employee** and press enter and save.

    ![Set visibility]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/set-visibility.png)


Developer Portal visibility is set to the API. Users with the **coltrain_employee** role can now view the API in the Developer Portal. 

Next task is to set the access control for the resources. For that follow these steps

1. Create a scope by selecting the **Develop → API Configurations → Local Scopes** and create a scope using the below details. Use **schedule_admin** as the role.

    ![Create scope]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/create-scope.png)

2. Go to **Develop → API Configurations → Resources** section and assign the role to the relevant resource. For example, to set the **schedule_admin** scope to `POST /schedule` resource, select this resource to expand and select the scope from **Operation scope** drop down menu.

    ![Set scope]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/set-scope.png)

3. Deploy the API. For that, go to the **Deploy → Deployments** section and click deploy.
4. Define a business plan for the API. For that, go to **Develop → Portal Configurations → Subscriptions** and select a business plan. (ex: Unlimited).
5. Publish the API using Publish → Lifecycle option.
   
Now go to the Developer Portal and go to the ColTrain’s domain. You would not be able to not see the **ColTrainInternalTimeTableAPI** api.

![Not visible]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/not-visible.png)

Lets login using `jenny@coltrain.com`. Use `user123` as the password. Now you should be able to see the API. 

![Visible]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/visible.png)


Jenny has **coltrain_employee** role and as a result she can view the API. 


Now lets try out the API.

1. Login to the Developer Portal using user `jenny@coltrain.com` and password `user123`.
2. Go to **Applications → Add new Application** and create an application and generate keys.
3. Copy the key and the secret. Secret can be viewed by clicking the icon next the Consumer Secret section.

    ![Generate keys]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/scenarios/gen-keys.png)

4. Subscribe to the API using this application.

Now we will try to access this API using two different access tokens generated by two different users. User **jenny@coltrain.com** has **schedule_admin** role assigned to her. **george@coltrain.com** does not have this role assigned to him. 

Since the _POST /schedule_ resource is protected using scope **schedule_admin** scope, lets create access tokens with this scope using the previously generated clientid and secret. Use the following commands.

For Jenny
```
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token -d "grant_type=password&username=jenny@coltrain.com&password=user123&scope=schedule_admin" -H "Authorization: Basic Base64(consumer-key:consumer-secret)"
```

For george
```
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token -d "grant_type=password&username=george@coltrain.com&password=user123&scope=schedule_admin" -H "Authorization: Basic Base64(consumer-key:consumer-secret)"
```


If you check the responses of the above two requests, you would see that for the first response, there will be a scope **schedule_admin** in the response payload.


Invoke the POST resource using each token.

```
curl -X POST "https://localhost:8243/t/coltrain.com/coltrain-schedule/1.0.0/schedules" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -H  "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d "{\"entryId\":\"10\",\"startTime\":\"18:30\",\"endTime\":\"20.30\",\"from\":\"London\",\"to\":\"Oxford\",\"trainType\":\"Standard\"}" -v
```


You would see that you could access the resource using jenny@coltrain.com user’s token and you would get an error message for george’s token.

```
{"code":"900910","message":"The access token does not allow you to access the requested resource","description":"User is NOT authorized to access the Resource: /schedules. Scope validation failed."}
```


You could tryout the same commands using the Postman collection provided in the **resources/Access_Control_Demo.postman_collection.json** location as well. You need to add the client_id and client_secret under the variable section to use this.
